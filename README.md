# ATtiny13A Makefile project

This is a simple example Makefile cross compiling project for the AVR ATtiny13A
microcontroller.

## Makefile rules

This Makefile is very simple and have two important rules.

### all

Compile the program in the `main.cpp` file to a `main.hex` flashable HEX file.

This rule is made for a single source code file and adjustments will be
required in order to adapt it to a multiple file project (however remember
there is only 1K flash on the chip soâ€¦).

### flash

This rule will flash the `main.hex` file to the microcontroller using the
`/dev/ttyUSB0` serial port interface, which is an Arduino with ICSP firmware
in my case but this may work with any serial USB flash tool I guess.
